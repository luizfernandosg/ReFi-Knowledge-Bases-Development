# Objectives



## TL;DR

Proposal: organize initial activities working around the following objectives as a ReFi DAO working group:
- 1. Local Node Knowledge Base
	- **Objective 1.1.:** Develop pilot version (V1) of a ReFi Local Node knowledge base & website for ReFi Barcelona
	- **Objective 1.2.:** Document Knowledge Base & website architecture and implementation process in framework for adoption by Local Nodes
- 2. ReFi DAO Knowledge Infrastructure
	- **Objective 2.1.:** Continue development and refine ReFi DAO's map based on the existing database and prepare for publication.
	- **Objective 2.2.:** Explore ReFi DAO's DB data structure and interoperability
- 3. ReFi Knowledge & Infrastructure (or something else) Working Group
	- **Objective 3.1.:** Initiate regular meetings, collaborative workspaces, and communication channels to activate the working group.
	- **Objective 3.2.:** Engage and onboard other individuals and groups to foster collaboration and integrate various initiatives working in similar fields.


## 1. Local Node Knowledge Base
Assigned to: @luizfernando

### **Objective 1.1.:** Develop pilot version (V1) of a ReFi Local Node knowledge base & website for ReFi Barcelona

Craft a pilot knowledge base specifically tailored for ReFi Barcelona.

- Components:
	- **Content**: Curate and compile relevant information.
	- **Infrastructure**: Establish a robust and user-friendly framework.
	- **Website**: Integrate the knowledge base with a website interface.
- Characteristics:
	- **Modularity**: Ensure each component is interchangeable and easily modified.
	- **Interoperability**: Facilitate seamless interaction between different systems and tools.
	- **Replicability**: Design the infrastructure to be easily duplicated for other ReFi local nodes and working groups.
- Tools:
	- **GitHub Repository**: Host and manage the knowledge base content.
	- **Obsidian Publish**: Present the knowledge base online.
- Outcome: The knowledge base will double as the official website for ReFi BCN.
    - Website Link: [ReFi Barcelona on Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/refi-barcelona/ReFi+Barcelona)
    - GitHub Repo: [ReFi Barcelona GitHub Repository](https://github.com/luizfernandosg/ReFi-Barcelona)

### **Objective 1.2.:** Document Knowledge Base & website architecture and implementation process in framework for adoption by Local Nodes

Focus on detailing the structure, entry templates, and interoperability aspects of the knowledge base.

- Key Areas:
	- **Documentation**: Create comprehensive guides and references for the knowledge base structure.
	- **Interoperability Framework**: Develop strategies for efficient data exchange and compatibility.
	- **Framework for Local Nodes**: Formulate a standardized framework to assist in setting up local node knowledge bases.
- Considerations:
	- Might include integrating the ReFi DAO knowledge base imported from Airtable.
	- Explore potential for GitHub and Airtable integration.

Assigned to: @anton

###  **Objective 2.1.:** Continue development and refine ReFi DAO's map based on the existing database and prepare for publication.

https://www.refidao.com/ecosystem/map

Requirements:
- access to ReFi DAO's database

### **Objective 2.2.:** Explore ReFi DAO's DB data structure and interoperability

- **Build and Integrate ReFi DAO Knowledge Base**
  - Structure an initial knowledge base for ReFi DAO using its current 
  - Actions:
    - Import and organize existing data, primarily focusing on open-source information.
    - Assess and implement integrations with tools like Airtable and Murmurations for enhanced functionality and data management. 


## 3. ReFi Knowledge & Infrastructure (or something else) Working Group

- **Objective 3.1.:** Initiate regular meetings, collaborative workspaces, and communication channels to activate the working group.

- **Objective 3.2.:** Engage and onboard other individuals and groups to foster collaboration and integrate various initiatives working in similar fields.
