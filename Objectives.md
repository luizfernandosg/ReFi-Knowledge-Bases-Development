# Objectives

Each objective focuses on a specific aspect of developing and enhancing the ReFi knowledge base, from initial creation and infrastructure setup to detailed documentation and expansion to encompass ReFi DAO. The goal is to create a scalable, flexible, and user-friendly knowledge base that can be adapted and replicated for different local nodes and purposes within the ReFi community.

**Objective 1: Establish ReFi Barcelona Knowledge Base**

- **Develop Initial Version (V1) of ReFi Barcelona Knowledge Base**
  - Aim: Craft a pilot knowledge base specifically tailored for ReFi Barcelona.
  - Components:
    - **Content**: Curate and compile relevant information.
    - **Infrastructure**: Establish a robust and user-friendly framework.
    - **Website**: Integrate the knowledge base with a website interface.
  - Characteristics:
    - **Modularity**: Ensure each component is interchangeable and easily modified.
    - **Interoperability**: Facilitate seamless interaction between different systems and tools.
    - **Replicability**: Design the infrastructure to be easily duplicated for other ReFi local nodes and working groups.
  - Tools:
    - **GitHub Repository**: Host and manage the knowledge base content.
    - **Obsidian Publish**: Present the knowledge base online.
  - Outcome: The knowledge base will double as the official website for ReFi BCN.

    - GitHub Repo: [ReFi Barcelona GitHub Repository](https://github.com/luizfernandosg/ReFi-Barcelona)

**Objective 2: Document Knowledge Base Architecture and prepare framework for adoption by Local Nodes**

- **Outline Knowledge Base Architecture**
  - Focus on detailing the structure, entry templates, and interoperability aspects of the knowledge base.
  - Key Areas:
    - **Documentation**: Create comprehensive guides and references for the knowledge base structure.
    - **Interoperability Framework**: Develop strategies for efficient data exchange and compatibility.
    - **Framework for Local Nodes**: Formulate a standardized framework to assist in setting up local node knowledge bases.
  - Considerations:
    - Might include integrating the ReFi DAO knowledge base imported from Airtable.
    - Explore potential for GitHub and Airtable integration.

**Objective 3: Fork ReFi DAO's Knowledge graph and explore interoperability**

- **Build and Integrate ReFi DAO Knowledge Base**
  - Structure an initial knowledge base for ReFi DAO using its current 
  - Actions:
    - Import and organize existing data, primarily focusing on open-source information.
    - Assess and implement integrations with tools like Airtable and Murmurations for enhanced functionality and data management. 

**Objective 4: Activate and integrate ReFi DAO working group**

- Set and facilitate open recurrent meetings and work/comms spaces
- Invite individuals and groups working on the
