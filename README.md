# ReFi-Knowledge-Bases-Development

This repository contains concepts and resources for the development of the decentralized interoperable ReFi Knowledge Base.

## Mission

There are many projects, networks and application aiming to bring people together for change, collective action and manifesting new regenerative structures.

Every project and network has their specific focus and idea about change and we acknowledge that their are myriads of ideas, apps and databases working in their way with their tools and technologies. Thatâ€™s why the big challenge of our time is to integrate all these puzzle pieces.

Our Goal is to connect various data sources with projects, people, events, places, resources and everything else needed for regeneration.

See [ReFi Barcelona Repository](https://github.com/antontranelis/ReFi-Barcelona/) for a sample implementation.
