# ReFi-Knowledge-Bases-Development

This repository contains concepts and resources for the development of the decentralized interoperable ReFi Knowledge Base.

## Mission

There are many projects, networks and application aiming to bring people together for change, collective action and manifesting new regenerative structures.

Every project and network has their specific focus and idea about change and we acknowledge that their are myriads of ideas, apps and databases working in their way with their tools and technologies.

We see the big challenge of our time in the integration of all these puzzle pieces.

Our Goal is to create design patterns for an open ecosystem of users, projects, apps and databases which integrates in the best way possible with all the existing and future projects and networks. 

Using open data standards and opensource technology we want to enable as much projects and networks as possible to plug into each other and share their data and users.
